    <p>
        I develop and maintain this application entirely on my own, using my
        spare time and passion for democratizing technology. My goal is to keep
        this application completely free and without ads, so anyone—whether
        you're a student, professional, entrepreneur, or simply a data
        enthusiast—can get life easier from it. 📊
    </p>

    <p>
        Therefore, if my application saved you some headaches or saved your
        valuable time, how about fueling future updates with a coffee? Your
        support keeps the code flowing, and the caffeine, too! 🧑‍💻
